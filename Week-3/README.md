# Logic Gates and Symbols 

Logic gates are important to understanding how conditional statements operate, they are quite easy to catch on 

## AND 

| A | B | RESULT  |
|:-:|:-:|:-------:|
| 0 | 0 | 0       |
| 1 | 0 | 0       |
| 0 | 1 | 0       |
| 1 | 1 | 1       |

## OR 

| A | B | RESULT  |
|:-:|:-:|:-------:|
| 0 | 0 | 0       |
| 1 | 0 | 1       |
| 0 | 1 | 1       |
| 1 | 1 | 1       |

## XOR 

| A | B | RESULT  |
|:-:|:-:|:-------:|
| 0 | 0 | 0       |
| 1 | 0 | 1       |
| 0 | 1 | 1       |
| 1 | 1 | 0       |

## NAND 

| A | B | RESULT  |
|:-:|:-:|:-------:|
| 0 | 0 | 1       |
| 1 | 0 | 1       |
| 0 | 1 | 1       |
| 1 | 1 | 0       |

## NOR 

| A | B | RESULT  |
|:-:|:-:|:-------:|
| 0 | 0 | 1       |
| 1 | 0 | 0       |
| 0 | 1 | 0       |
| 1 | 1 | 0       |

## XNOR

| A | B | RESULT  |
|:-:|:-:|:-------:|
| 0 | 0 | 1       |
| 1 | 0 | 0       |
| 0 | 1 | 0       |
| 1 | 1 | 1       |


## Symbols for conditional statements

| Symbol | Meaning |
|:------:|:-------:|
| AND    | AND (Both statements must be true)|
| OR     | OR (Either statement can be true)|
| NOT    | When something is not (If x is not in a list it will evaluate to true)|
| IN     | Checking if something is within a list|
| ==     | Equals to (Double == must be used for evaulation)|
| !=     | Not equal to |
| <      | Less than |
| >      | Greater than|
| <=     | Less than or equal to|
| >=     | Greater than or equal to|

There is more but these are the basic ones that you use most regularly
