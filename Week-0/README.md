## Git desktop 
Git desktop is a much easier version of git which provides a UI but is limited as you can’t use nearly as many commands as Git bash. This is why you need both.

**Install Here** : https://desktop.github.com/ 

This is a simple installer which should be pretty straight forward 

___ 
## Anaconda 
Anaconda is a Python distribution, pretty much has all the stuff you need including visual studio code and notebooks. Later on we might move onto pure Python but for now this is an easy way to get started 

**Install Here** : https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual  

Follow the default installation instructions 

Open up Anaconda Navigator and confirm that Jupyter Notebook, VS code and JupyterLab is installed. If not, install it by clicking the button install. These can be found in the home of the navigator as seen below
